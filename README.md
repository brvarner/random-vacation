This app takes a date and gives you a country to visit on that date. It also gives you information on that country from the CIA world factbook, a conversion from USD into that country's currency, and a forecast of the temperature and inches of precipitation on that day. 

To run this app, you have two options.

1. Visit the deployed app on Render:

2. Clone the app, run the `bundle install` command, then `bin/server` to start a local server.
